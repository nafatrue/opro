	<p><u><strong>What happens when I join OneCoin</strong><strong>? </strong></u></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>When you open OneCoin account, you receive e-mail verification, confirming your registration as a client. We also automatically create an e-wallet for you. As a company that offers different services, we allow people to join and see for themselves how our business works. This however does not grant access to all products and services. If a client wants full access to all OneCoin's offers, then s/he must go through a KYC application process. Because of our centralized model, we take care of all technical aspects, ensuring that your mined coins are safe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><u><strong>How does it work?</strong></u></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>To use OneCoin cryptocurrency you need to create an account at OneCoin. This happens by invitation from another miner, thus you become a part of the OneLife Network global community. You are supported by our education platform via OneAcademy, by your OneLife Network and by the Support department.You need to decide what your business objective is when creating an account at OneCoin - to benefit from our learning platform, to mine the coin, etc. Besides mining the coin, you can also make payments and transfer money from any part of the world fast, easy and safely.</p>

	<li>
	<p><u><strong>What is blockchain?</strong></u></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The blockchain is a digital technology for recording and verifying transactions. It is a key concept behind innovations related to cryptocurrencies in general, and OneCoin in particular.The blockchain was first introduced as an alternative mechanism for the trust between two parties that make transactions that differentiated it from the way traditional institutions like banks or escrow agents processed payments.Most recently the blockchain is considered a powerful tool that can provide new products and services, and improve traditional ones. The number of financial institutions and firms across industries that are using the distributed ledger technology as a secure and transparent way to digitally track the ownership of assets is constantly increasing. This is a move that helps companies to speed up transactions and cut cross border remittances while lowering the risk of fraud.At OneCoin, we are able to execute your transactions in a minute thanks to the powerful blockchain – a technological innovation that stores cryptocurrencies. The OneCoin blockchain is based on protocols that authenticate, validate and store information in consistent, unbroken sequences. This guarantees that the system is safer by reducing fraud, duplicity and forgery. OneCoin is the first cryptocurrency company both storing KYC documents on its blockchain and performing a monthly audit of its blockchain</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><u><strong>What is a cryptocurrency? </strong></u></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Like fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies function as a medium of exchange. Because it is based on cryptography, cryptocurrency is difficult to counterfeit. Cryptography protocols are used to make transactions safe and to control the process of new coin creation.OneCoin cryptocurrency is not pre-mined, meaning that the miners create the market. OneCoin is easy to mine, easy to trade and easy to use. Thanks to the way OneCoin has structured its organization and operations, all mined coins are safe and cannot get lost because of a technical issue.Because cryptocurrencies are not tied to any particular country or central bank, the value of the coin depends on factors such as useability, demand and supply. Therefore they are often compared to gold, hence called 'virtual gold'. The more a cryptocurrency is used, the more its value rises. With its millions of followers, OneCoin has quickly become the second largest in the world with a market cap of 2,9 Billion in February 2016.Because of market specifics, Asian customers became early adopters of cryptocurrencies, recognizing their advantages such as making payments directly, without the need of expensive or unsafe intermediaries. Contrary to bank transactions, OneCoin offers faster, cheaper and easier way to send and receive money worldwide.</p>
