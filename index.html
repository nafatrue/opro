					<h1>What is the <span>CryptoCurrency?</span></h1>
					<div class="advantages-bg"></div>
					<p>OneCoin is an innovative virtual currency<br />  <br/>
Cryptocurrency the cryptocurrencies are based on the
principle of cryptography. Which main purpose is to protect the unauthorized usage of the
decoded data. With other words, in order to “read ”the cryptocurrency, the client needs to
possess a specific “reader” this is exactly the reason of the high security of cryptocurrencies.
OneCoin is offering all of those - security, innovation, reliability and, last but not least profitability.
Nowadays, the cryptocurrency is getting a widely used investment tool exactly because of the
high security. It is well known especially in financially matured countries such as China, and USA.  <br /> <br />
I
am currently noticing a very positive development trend in Bulgaria, wich is making me happy.
People are opening their minds for more alternative investment tools and are starting to realize
the future opportunities of OneCoin.  <br /> <br />
As I mentioned, just as any other cryptocurrency OneCoin is based on cryptography, however,
what make oneCoin different from other cryptocurrencies is is way more dynamic and fast
developing . For example – bitcoin, it has been known since 2009 but it scored its peak in 2014,
OneCoin succeeded for less then a year to speed up and achieve the fame of a very well known
cryptocurrency not only in the European countries but also Asia. Thailand, Russia and the USA,We
are also expecting future success in Latin America.<br /> <br />
I succeeded to introduce OneCoin and to convince clients from all around the world of its security
and potential. I believe in the future of the currency and I know that this is only the beginning of
a long success story of the company.</p>

			<h1>One Coin 
				<span> - future</span>

			<div class="future-block-left">
				<p>
					

As the end of the year draws closer it is time to look back at the challenges OneCoin met and the achievements we accomplished this year. 2016 was a true game changer for OneCoin cryptocurrency and by far the most eventful one since the establishment of the company in 2014.

 

The price of the coin has almost doubled in price over the last 12 months. From 3,35 EUR in December 2015 to 7,84 EUR in December 2016. As the OneCoin price is defined by its usability, supply and demand, this shows that more and more people are turning to the currency as a means of conducting their financial operations. The total number of users registered in the OneLife Network also increased from 730 000 in December 2015 to over 2,8 million in December 2016.
 

2016 also marked two major changes for the company – the official separation of the OneLife Network and the OneCoin cryptocurrency brand in June and the launch of the new and enhanced OneCoin blockchain in October.

 

The founder and Visionary of OneCoin Dr. Ruja Ignatova announced that a steep price movement after the launch of the new blockchain is not expected, and in the following months the OneCoin value did remain stable. “Cryptocurrency value is driven by supply and demand, and demand is driven by brand and usability. By creating more coins, we will be able to bring the coin to more people and places and strengthen the brand”, she added in June at the SSE Arena, Wembley.

 

The launch of the new blockchain also marked an increase in the amount of coins available to ensure improved usability and market capitalization. The total amount of mineable OneCoins increased from 10 000 coins per block in the old blockchain to 50 000 coins per block in the new blockchain, adding up to a total of 120 billion coins. This not only allows OneCoin to expand its user base, but also helps make the company's strategic plans for creating a strong global merchant network a reality. “Our goal has always been to make cryptocurrency a real, borderless method for transactions and these changes will bring us much closer to that goal", said Dr. Ignatova.

 

“We don’t want to be in the Top 3 anymore. We are now aiming for Number 1. That means we need the biggest market capitalization, usability and highest number of users, and I believe we are already at the top when it comes to users”, stated Dr. Ignatova.

 

All these developments show that OneCoin is here to stay for the long term and look toward 2017 confident in its success.
